# CV_Valeriane_Aron
A small resume of who I am and what I've done so far.
I started this project in 2018 to use and grow my skills in a personal project.
The first version was inspired by a one pager template, since the idea was to make something simple. This was also a way to start learning Javascript through small scripts here and there... 
Css remains very basic, it is a choice not to go too deep into configuration through a webpack setup for example.

## What I want for this project

The idea is to keep this page as an ongoing witness of my growing skills.

## My short-term objectives

- turn css into sass - because it's how I'm used to code, and it's very hard to go back to Stone Age :-))
- redevelop the project in Vue.Js, using components, which will make updates much more easier through the years!
